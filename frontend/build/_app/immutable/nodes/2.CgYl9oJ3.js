I am Cale Overstreet, a Ph.D. student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville in the Nuclear Engineering Department, specializing in the study of amorphous phases of complex oxides and their associated physical properties. I have had the privilege of performing experiments at national and international user facilities,  I hold an undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Tennessee Knoxville.

					Beyond the academic sphere, I enjoy learning and becoming proficient with programming, which serves both as a research tool and a personal pursuit. In my free-time, I enjoy playing guitar and exploring Knoxville through cycling.</p></div>`,M,S,h,j="",_;r=new U({});let m=O(l[0]),n=[];for(let e=0;e<m.length;e+=1)n[e]=z(D(l,m,e));const J=e=>x(n[e],1,1,()=>{n[e]=null});return{c(){P(r.$$.fragment),s=w(),t=g("div"),o=g("div"),o.innerHTML=E,b=w(),c=g("div"),d=g("div"),d.innerHTML=$,M=w();for(let e=0;e<n.length;e+=1)n[e].c();S=w(),h=g("div"),h.innerHTML=j,this.h()},l(e){R(r.$$.fragment,e),s=C(e),t=v(e,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0});var i=T(t);o=v(i,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(o)!=="svelte-kvja11"&&(o.innerHTML=E),b=C(i),c=v(i,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0});var a=T(c);d=v(a,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(d)!=="svelte-1wgr4ly"&&(d.innerHTML=$),M=C(a);for(let p=0;p<n.length;p+=1)n[p].l(a);a.forEach(k),S=C(i),h=v(i,"DIV",{style:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(h)!=="svelte-1qcjg2t"&&(h.innerHTML=j),i.forEach(k),this.h()},h(){u(o,"id","intro-banner"),u(o,"class","svelte-xzyvf2"),u(d,"id","about-me"),u(d,"class","card svelte-xzyvf2"),u(c,"id","main-content"),u(c,"class","svelte-xzyvf2"),Q(h,"height","100vh"),u(t,"id","daiscund"),u(t,"class","svelte-xzyvf2")},m(e,i){B(r,e,i),L(e,s,i),L(e,t,i),f(t,o),f(t,b),f(t,c),f(c,d),f(c,M);for(let a=0;a<n.length;a+=1)n[a]&&n[a].m(c,null);f(t,S),f(t,h),_=!0},p(e,[i]){if(i&1){m=O(e[0]);let a;for(a=0;a<m.length;a+=1){const p=D(e,m,a);n[a]?(n[a].p(p,i),y(n[a],1)):(n[a]=z(p),n[a].c(),y(n[a],1),n[a].m(c,null))}for(X(),a=m.length;a<n.length;a+=1)J(a);V()}},i(e){if(!_){y(r.$$.fragment,e);for(let i=0;i<m.length;i+=1)y(n[i]);_=!0}},o(e){x(r.$$.fragment,e),n=n.filter(Boolean);for(let i=0;i<n.length;i+=1)x(n[i]);_=!1},d(e){e&&(k(s),k(t)),H(r,e),W(n,e)}}}function F(l){return[{title:"Structural stability of REE-PO4 (REE=Sm,Tb) under swift heavy ion irradiation",authors:["Cale Overstreet","Jacob Cooper","Eric O'Quinn","William Cureton","Raul Palomares","Julia Leys","Guido Deissmann","Stefan Neumeier","Chien-Hung Chen","Maik Lang"],journal:"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms",date:"2022",link:"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X22001884"},{title:"Comparison of short-range order in irradiated dysprosium titanates",authors:["Roman Sherrod","Eric C O’Quinn","Igor M Gussev","Cale Overstreet","Joerg Neuefeind","Maik K Lang"],journal:"npj Materials Degradation",date:"2021",link:"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41529-021-00165-6"},{title:"Systematic study of short-and long-range correlations in RE 3 TaO 7 weberite-type compounds by neutron total scattering and X-ray diffraction",authors:["Igor M Gussev","Eric C O'Quinn","Matthew Tucker","Rodney C Ewing","Cale Overstreet","Jörg Neuefeind","Michelle Everett","Qiang Zhang","David Sprouster","Daniel Olds","Gianguido Baldinozzi","Maik Lang"],journal:"Journal of Materials Chemistry A",date:"2023",link:"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41529-021-00165-6"},{title:"Swift heavy ion irradiation effects in zirconium and hafnium carbides",authors:["Evan Williams","Jacob Minnette","Eric O'Quinn","Alexandre Solomon","Cale Overstreet","William F Cureton","Ina Schubert","Christina Trautman","Changyong Park","Maxim Zdorovets","Maik Lang"],journal:"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms",date:"2024",link:"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X2400017X"}].sort((s,t)=>s.date<t.date),[[{title:"Research",subtitle:"Characterization and analysis of amorphous phases of complex oxides",imageSrc:"REI-presentation.jpg",link:"/research"},{title:"Gallery",subtitle:"Random photos from research/travel/personal",imageSrc:"daiscund.jpg",link:"/gallery"},{title:"Projects",subtitle:"Personal projects",imageSrc:"CCOEspLight.JPG",link:"/projects"}]]}class ie extends A{constructor(r){super(),K(this,r,F,Z,N,{})}}export{ie as component};
