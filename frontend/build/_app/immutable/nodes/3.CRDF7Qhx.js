I am Cale Overstreet, a Ph.D. student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville in the Nuclear Engineering Department, specializing in the study of amorphous phases of complex oxides and their ceffects on physical properties. I have had the privilege of performing experiments at national and international user facilities,  I hold an undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Tennessee Knoxville, which provided me me with a solid foundation for my current academic pursuits.

					<br/> <br/>

					Beyond the academic sphere, I enjoy learning and becoming proficient with programming, which serves both as a research tool and a personal pursuit. In my free-time, I enjoy playing guitar and exploring Knoxville through cycling.</p></div>`,S,x,h,j="",_;r=new U({});let m=O(l[0]),i=[];for(let e=0;e<m.length;e+=1)i[e]=P(D(l,m,e));const N=e=>b(i[e],1,1,()=>{i[e]=null});return{c(){R(r.$$.fragment),s=k(),t=g("div"),o=g("div"),o.innerHTML=E,M=k(),c=g("div"),d=g("div"),d.innerHTML=$,S=k();for(let e=0;e<i.length;e+=1)i[e].c();x=k(),h=g("div"),h.innerHTML=j,this.h()},l(e){B(r.$$.fragment,e),s=w(e),t=v(e,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0});var n=T(t);o=v(n,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(o)!=="svelte-kvja11"&&(o.innerHTML=E),M=w(n),c=v(n,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0});var a=T(c);d=v(a,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(d)!=="svelte-12wm6c5"&&(d.innerHTML=$),S=w(a);for(let f=0;f<i.length;f+=1)i[f].l(a);a.forEach(C),x=w(n),h=v(n,"DIV",{style:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(h)!=="svelte-1qcjg2t"&&(h.innerHTML=j),n.forEach(C),this.h()},h(){u(o,"id","intro-banner"),u(o,"class","svelte-37lkop"),u(d,"id","about-me"),u(d,"class","card svelte-37lkop"),u(c,"id","main-content"),u(c,"class","svelte-37lkop"),Q(h,"height","100vh"),u(t,"id","daiscund"),u(t,"class","svelte-37lkop")},m(e,n){H(r,e,n),L(e,s,n),L(e,t,n),p(t,o),p(t,M),p(t,c),p(c,d),p(c,S);for(let a=0;a<i.length;a+=1)i[a]&&i[a].m(c,null);p(t,x),p(t,h),_=!0},p(e,[n]){if(n&1){m=O(e[0]);let a;for(a=0;a<m.length;a+=1){const f=D(e,m,a);i[a]?(i[a].p(f,n),y(i[a],1)):(i[a]=P(f),i[a].c(),y(i[a],1),i[a].m(c,null))}for(X(),a=m.length;a<i.length;a+=1)N(a);V()}},i(e){if(!_){y(r.$$.fragment,e);for(let n=0;n<m.length;n+=1)y(i[n]);_=!0}},o(e){b(r.$$.fragment,e),i=i.filter(Boolean);for(let n=0;n<i.length;n+=1)b(i[n]);_=!1},d(e){e&&(C(s),C(t)),J(r,e),W(i,e)}}}function F(l){return[{title:"Structural stability of REE-PO4 (REE=Sm,Tb) under swift heavy ion irradiation",authors:["Cale Overstreet","Jacob Cooper","Eric O'Quinn","William Cureton","Raul Palomares","Julia Leys","Guido Deissmann","Stefan Neumeier","Chien-Hung Chen","Maik Lang"],journal:"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms",date:"2022",link:"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X22001884"},{title:"Comparison of short-range order in irradiated dysprosium titanates",authors:["Roman Sherrod","Eric C O’Quinn","Igor M Gussev","Cale Overstreet","Joerg Neuefeind","Maik K Lang"],journal:"npj Materials Degradation",date:"2021",link:"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41529-021-00165-6"},{title:"Systematic study of short-and long-range correlations in RE 3 TaO 7 weberite-type compounds by neutron total scattering and X-ray diffraction",authors:["Igor M Gussev","Eric C O'Quinn","Matthew Tucker","Rodney C Ewing","Cale Overstreet","Jörg Neuefeind","Michelle Everett","Qiang Zhang","David Sprouster","Daniel Olds","Gianguido Baldinozzi","Maik Lang"],journal:"Journal of Materials Chemistry A",date:"2023",link:"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41529-021-00165-6"},{title:"Swift heavy ion irradiation effects in zirconium and hafnium carbides",authors:["Evan Williams","Jacob Minnette","Eric O'Quinn","Alexandre Solomon","Cale Overstreet","William F Cureton","Ina Schubert","Christina Trautman","Changyong Park","Maxim Zdorovets","Maik Lang"],journal:"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms",date:"2024",link:"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X2400017X"}].sort((s,t)=>s.date<t.date),[[{title:"Research",subtitle:"Characterization and analysis of amorphous phases of complex oxides",imageSrc:"REI-presentation.jpg",link:"/research"},{title:"Gallery",subtitle:"Random photos from research/travel/personal",imageSrc:"daiscund.jpg",link:"/gallery"},{title:"Projects",subtitle:"Personal projects",imageSrc:"CCOEspLight.JPG",link:"/projects"}]]}class ne extends A{constructor(r){super(),K(this,r,F,Z,G,{})}}export{ne as component};
